# Study Guide Feature Improvements

## Overview
The study guide feature has been significantly enhanced with better navigation, progress tracking, analytics, and user experience improvements.

## New Features

### 1. Enhanced Study Guide Component (`EnhancedStudyGuide.tsx`)
- **Smart Content Parsing**: Automatically parses markdown study guides into structured sections with metadata (type, inferred difficulty, time estimate, importance)
- **Interactive Navigation**: Table of contents with completion indicators, bookmark stars, and quick expand/collapse
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time completion %, last studied badge, cumulative time spent (minutes) with debounced persistence
- **Study Modes**: (Pluggable) Room for future mode-specific UIs (base view currently active)
- **Search & Multi-Filter Bar**: Live search plus composable filters:
	- Status: All / Completed / Remaining / Bookmarked
	- Type: overview / concepts / details / questions / summary (multi-select)
	- Difficulty: beginner / intermediate / advanced (multi-select)
	- Counts & `aria-pressed` for accessibility on all filter controls
- **Difficulty Badges**: Colored chips (green=beginner, yellow=intermediate, red=advanced) per section
- **Bookmarks**: Inline star toggle in TOC & section header; dedicated Bookmarked filter
- **Diagram Generation**: Per-section Mermaid diagram buttons (flowchart, sequence, class, ER, state) with throttled calls & lazy-loaded renderer
- **Optimistic UI**: Immediate local updates for completion & bookmarks with rollback on error
- **Debounced Saves**: Batched PUT calls consolidating section completion, timeSpent, and bookmark changes (reduces network chatter)
- **Raw Markdown Toggle**: Switch between enhanced view and raw source
- **Mark All / Reset**: Bulk complete all sections or reset progress safely

### 2. Intelligent Content Analysis (`studyGuideUtils.ts`)
- **Section Classification**: Categorizes content (overview, concepts, details, questions, summary) using titles + heuristics
- **Difficulty Inference**: Per-section difficulty derived from user requirements + lexical cues (default intermediate)
- **Time & Importance Heuristics**: Distributes estimated minutes proportionally to target duration if specified
- **Keyword Extraction**: Pulls capitalized & technical tokens for future semantic search/indexing
- **Recommendations Engine**: Flags imbalances (too many advanced sections, lack of overview, etc.)
- **Diagram Injection Utility**: Safe insertion of Mermaid diagrams into the source markdown respecting section markers

### 3. Database-Backed Progress Tracking
- **StudyProgress Model**: Persists sectionsCompleted, timeSpent (minutes), bookmarks, lastStudied timestamp
- **Section Completion**: Durable across sessions; optimistic writes with eventual consistency
- **Time Tracking**: Interval-based minute accumulation with flush on unload
- **Bookmarks**: Stored server-side; toggle endpoint returns updated set
- **Last Studied**: `@updatedAt` powered timestamp surfaced as relative badge
- *(Planned)* Personal notes & preferences expansion (schema placeholder patterns maintained)

### 4. Backend API Endpoints (Current)
- `GET /api/study/sets/:id/guide/progress` → Returns `{ sectionsCompleted, timeSpent, bookmarks, lastStudied }`
- `POST /api/study/sets/:id/guide/progress/complete` → Append one section (legacy flow; may be consolidated)
- `PUT /api/study/sets/:id/guide/progress` → Replace full progress (debounced batching)
- `POST /api/study/progress/:id/bookmark/:sectionId` → Toggle bookmark

### 5. Enhanced Integration
- **Unified Study Dashboard**: Central hub for guide + flashcards + tests + match
- **Bidirectional Linking**: Cross-navigation between flashcards/tests and source guide
- **Diagram Insert**: Generated Mermaid diagrams can be inserted into guide markdown
- **Notes Convergence**: Lecture Recorder feature deprecated—Jarvis Notes now the unified capture path
- **Resilient Persistence**: Debounced server writes with optimistic local state

### 6. Study Tools Generation
- **Top-Level Buttons**: Quick access to generate study tools from the entire guide
- **Flashcards**: Create flashcards based on the full study guide content
- **Tests**: Generate multiple-choice tests from guide content
- **Match Games**: Create term-definition matching games
- **Smart Content Processing**: AI analyzes entire guide to create comprehensive study materials

### 7. Study Tools Integration (Detail)
The enhanced guide exposes one-click generation for complementary learning artifacts:

| Tool | Trigger | Source Scope | Return Link Back | Status |
|------|---------|-------------|------------------|--------|
| Flashcards | Header button | Entire guide markdown | Yes (flashcards → guide) | Implemented |
| Test (MCQ) | Header button | Entire guide markdown | Yes (test → guide) via localStorage link | Implemented (beta) |
| Match Game | Header button | Entire guide markdown | Yes (match → guide) via localStorage link | Implemented (alpha) |
| Diagram Insert | Section toolbar | Single section text | N/A (in-place) | Implemented |

Planned Enhancements:
- Inline per-section flashcard quick-generate (subset extraction)
- Adaptive question difficulty based on section difficulty tags
- Multi-round test regeneration preserving incorrectly answered items

Navigation routes:
- Flashcards: /study/sets/:id/flashcards
- Test (MCQ): /study/sets/:id/test
- Match Game: /study/sets/:id/match

## Next steps

To round out the study guide integrations and UX, here are the prioritized follow-ups:

- Persist reverse links in the database (Implemented: schema + server; wire client progressively)
	- Add sourceGuideId to tool artifacts (flashcards/test/match) in StudySet
	- Use backend fields instead of localStorage for cross-device consistency

- Persist diagram insertions to the server (Implemented: PATCH endpoint + client save)
	- Add PATCH /api/study/sets/:id to update content.guide
	- Wire “Insert” to save-and-refresh the guide after injecting Mermaid blocks

- Per-section flashcard generation (subset decks) (Implemented in UI)
	- Add quick-generate button in each section’s toolbar
	- Use section content as input to generate a smaller, focused deck

- Adaptive test generation (Initial hints wired via adapt field)
	- Adjust question difficulty using section difficulty tags and user progress
	- Optionally regenerate tests focusing on incorrect answers from prior attempts

- Bundle and performance
	- Manual chunking for Mermaid/KaTeX to reduce initial bundle size
	- Background prefetch for Study Tools pages after guide load

- UX polish
	- Persist filter selections per-guide (status/type/difficulty/bookmarks)
	- Add empty states and loading indicators for tool creation actions

## Key Improvements

### User Experience
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on desktop and mobile devices
- **Accessibility**: Proper keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- **Performance**: Efficient rendering with lazy loading for large guides
- **Customization**: User preferences for colors, icons, and layout

### Learning Features
- **Adaptive Learning**: (Planned) Deeper personalization using per-section difficulty & completion timing
- **Spaced Repetition**: Flashcards integrate with existing SRS
- **Progress Visualization**: Progress bar, last studied badge, completion counts
- **Study Analytics**: (Foundational) Recommendations engine flags structural gaps

### Content Organization
